# Learning Multi-Robot Decentralized Macro-Action-Based Policies via a Centralized Q-Net

In this work, we first introduce a new macro-action-based decentralized multi-agent double deep recurrent Q-net (MacDec-MADDRQN) which adopts *centralized trainning with decentralized execution* by allowing each decentralized Q-net update to use a centralized Q-net for action selection.
